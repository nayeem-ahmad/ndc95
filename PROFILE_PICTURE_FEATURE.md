# Profile Picture Upload Feature

## Overview
Users can now change their profile picture by uploading from camera or gallery with cropping functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Picture Management
- **Default Photo**: Initially uses Google profile picture from authentication
- **Custom Upload**: Users can upload their own profile picture
- **Storage**: Images stored in Firebase Storage at `profile_pictures/{userId}.jpg`
- **Persistence**: Photo URL saved to both Firestore and Firebase Auth profile

### 2. Image Sources
Users can choose from two sources:
- **üì∑ Camera**: Take a new photo using device camera
- **üñºÔ∏è Gallery**: Select an existing photo from device gallery

### 3. Image Cropping
- **Square Crop**: Enforces square aspect ratio (1:1) for profile pictures
- **Resizable**: Users can zoom and pan to select the desired portion
- **Interactive UI**: 
  - Android: Material design cropper with blue toolbar
  - iOS: Native iOS cropper interface

### 4. User Interface

#### Profile Screen UI Changes:
- **Profile Picture Display**:
  - Circular avatar (80px diameter)
  - Network image loading from Firebase Storage or Google
  - Placeholder icon if no image available
  
- **Change Picture Button**:
  - Camera icon badge on bottom-right of profile picture
  - Blue circular button with white border
  - Tap to open image source selection

- **Loading State**:

### 5. Success & Error Handling

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added:
```yaml
image_picker: ^1.0.4      # Pick images from camera/gallery
image_cropper: ^5.0.1     # Crop images with UI
```

### Android Permissions (AndroidManifest.xml):

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>
```

### Firebase Storage Structure:
```
storage/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_pictures/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}.jpg    # One image per user, overwrites on update
```

### Firestore Data Structure:

```

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ‚úÖ Easy to change profile picture
- ‚úÖ Professional square cropping
- ‚úÖ Choice of camera or gallery
- ‚úÖ Instant preview after upload
- ‚úÖ No need to leave the app

### For Developers:
- ‚úÖ Firebase Storage integration
- ‚úÖ Automatic URL management
- ‚úÖ Profile sync across Firestore and Auth
- ‚úÖ Overwrite instead of accumulate (saves storage)
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

## Image Quality
- **Compression**: Images compressed to 80% quality during picking
- **Format**: Stored as JPEG (.jpg)
- **Storage Location**: Firebase Storage with auto-generated download URLs
- **Access**: Public read access via download URL

## Security Notes
- Images stored with user ID as filename (e.g., `userId.jpg`)
- Only authenticated users can upload
- Firebase Storage rules should be configured to:
  - Allow authenticated users to write to their own profile picture
  - Allow public read access to all profile pictures

## Storage Rules (Recommended):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile_pictures/{userId} {
      // Anyone can read profile pictures
      allow read: if true;
      
      // Only authenticated users can upload their own picture
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Filters and effects
- [ ] Image size validation (max 5MB)
