## Email and Student ID Uniqueness Implementation

### Email Uniqueness:
```dart
Future<bool> _isEmailUnique(String email) async {
  // If editing and email hasn't changed, it's valid
  if (_isEditMode && email.toLowerCase() == _originalEmail.toLowerCase()) {
    return true;
  }

  // Query Firestore for existing email
  final QuerySnapshot result = await FirebaseService.firestore
      .collection('users')
      .where('email', isEqualTo: email.toLowerCase())
      .limit(1)
      .get();

  return result.docs.isEmpty;
}
```

### Student ID Uniqueness:
```dart
Future<bool> _isStudentIdUnique(String studentId) async {
  // Empty student ID is allowed
  if (studentId.isEmpty) {
    return true;
  }

  // If editing and student ID hasn't changed, it's valid
  if (_isEditMode && studentId == _originalStudentId) {
    return true;
  }

  // Query Firestore for existing Student ID
  final QuerySnapshot result = await FirebaseService.firestore
      .collection('users')
      .where('studentId', isEqualTo: studentId)
      .limit(1)
      .get();

  return result.docs.isEmpty;
}
```

### Validation Flow:
1. User fills out form and clicks save
2. Form validation runs (required fields, email format)
3. Email uniqueness check queries Firestore
4. If email exists and it's not the same member, show error
5. Student ID uniqueness check queries Firestore
6. If Student ID exists and it's not the same member, show error
7. If both unique, proceed with save operation
8. Success message displayed and returns to member list
